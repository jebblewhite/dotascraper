A DotA 2 Professional Match Webscraper


The aim of this project is to take data from opendota's recent matches and store the match ids to be accessed individually for more in-depth data: team picks, team bans, and which team won. By taking this information, trends on hero pickrate, banrate, and winrate can be established. There is potential in future to predict which team will win a given match based on picks, as DotA is a highly competitive game and often the best picks can be the deciding factor.
